# AI Assistant for Obsidian

Run any LLM from inside your note. Select text, hit a hotkey, get the result inserted in place — with `[[wikilinks]]` automatically expanded, your own system prompts, and a choice of five providers including local CLI tools.

> **Status**: desktop-only · Obsidian ≥ 1.5.0 · `id: ai-assistant`

---

## Quick start

1. Install the plugin (see [Installation](#installation)).
2. Open **Settings → AI Assistant** and configure one provider — for example, paste a Claude API key.
3. In any note, select a sentence and run **Ask AI** from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`).
4. The result is inserted just below your selection under an `## AI Result` heading.

---

## What it does

A single command — **Ask AI** — runs the following pipeline every time you invoke it:

1. Reads the **selection** (or the current line if nothing is selected).
2. Optionally opens a **prompt picker** so you can choose a system-prompt file from a vault folder at invocation time.
3. **Expands `[[wikilinks]]`** in the input — `[[Note]]`, `[[Note#Heading]]`, or `[[Note#^block]]` — replacing them with the linked content before anything is sent to the LLM.
4. Optionally appends a list of **vault note names** to the system prompt so the LLM can write back resolvable wikilinks.
5. Sends the request to your configured provider.
6. Inserts the response into the note at the position you chose (after the selection, replacing the selection, or at the end of the file).

A persistent progress notice shows where you are in the pipeline and how long it has taken.

## Features

- **Five providers** — GitHub Copilot (any OpenAI-compatible endpoint), Anthropic Claude, Claude via OpenAI-compatible proxies (OpenRouter, Together, internal gateways), Google Gemini, and any local CLI (`claude`, `llm`, `gemini`, …).
- **Three prompt modes** — no system prompt, a static inline prompt, or pick a `.md` file from a vault folder at invocation time.
- **Wikilink expansion** with full support for nested heading paths (`#A#B`) and block references (`#^id`).
- **Vault-aware context** — optionally include a list of vault note names in the system prompt with glob-based exclusions (`Untitled*`, `Daily/*`, …) so the LLM can emit wikilinks that resolve.
- **Three insertion positions** — after selection (default), at cursor / replacing the selection, or end of file.
- **Configurable result heading** — set it to `AI Result`, leave blank to disable, or use any heading you like.
- **Debug mode** — prepend the exact request payload (provider, model, system prompt, user content) to the result so you can see what was sent.
- **Timeout** — applies to the local CLI provider (default 60 s).
- **No telemetry, no cloud account, no remote auto-update** — only the explicit LLM request leaves your machine.

---

## Requirements

- Obsidian **1.5.0** or later.
- **Desktop platform** (macOS, Windows, Linux). The CLI provider uses Node `child_process`, so the plugin is desktop-only.
- One of:
  - An API key for **Copilot** (or any OpenAI-compatible service), **Claude**, **a Claude proxy**, or **Gemini**, *or*
  - A **local CLI** tool installed and on your `PATH` (`claude`, `llm`, `gemini`, or any tool that reads from stdin and writes to stdout).

---

## Installation

### From the community plugin store

**Settings → Community plugins → Browse**, search for *AI Assistant*, install, enable.

### Manual

1. Download `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and `styles.css` from a release.
2. Copy them into `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ai-assistant/`.
3. Reload Obsidian and enable the plugin in **Settings → Community plugins**.

---

## Configuration

Open **Settings → AI Assistant**. The settings tab has five sections.

### 1. Provider and connection

- **Provider** — pick `Copilot`, `Claude`, `Claude (proxy)`, `Gemini`, or `Local CLI`.
- **Model** — leave blank to use the provider's default (`gpt-4.1-mini`, `claude-sonnet-4-20250514`, `gemini-2.0-flash`). For Claude proxies you must set this explicitly (e.g. `anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet` for OpenRouter).
- **Timeout (ms)** — used by the local CLI provider.

### 2. Credentials

The fields shown depend on the selected provider:

| Provider | Fields |
|---|---|
| Copilot | Base URL + API key |
| Claude | Base URL (defaults to `https://api.anthropic.com`) + API key |
| Claude (proxy) | Base URL + API key (Bearer token) |
| Gemini | Base URL (defaults to `https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com`) + API key |
| Local CLI | Command, optional args, optional working directory |

### 3. Prompt mode

- **None** — no system prompt.
- **Inline** — use the fixed prompt you type into settings. A toggle lets you skip sending it without losing it.
- **Pick at invocation** — show a picker every time the command runs so you can choose a `.md` file from a vault folder.

When picker mode is active, set **Prompts folder** to the vault-relative folder that holds your prompt notes (default: `Prompts/AI`).

### 4. Vault note names context

Optional. When on, the plugin appends a Markdown block listing every note in the vault to the system prompt, plus an instruction telling the LLM to wrap matches in `[[...]]`. **Exclusions** is a list of glob patterns:

- `Untitled*` — any note starting with "Untitled".
- `Screenshot*` — any clipboard-image note.
- `Daily/2024-*` — folder-scoped pattern (uses `/`).

### 5. Result insertion

- **Result heading** — Markdown heading inserted before the response. Empty string disables it.
- **Insert position** — `After selection` (default), `At cursor`, or `End of file`.
- **Debug** — prepend a debug block showing the exact provider, model, system prompt, and user content sent.

---

## Usage

Select text in any note and run **Ask AI** from the command palette (`Ctrl/Cmd+P`). If the selection is empty, the current line is used.

You can bind the command to a hotkey under **Settings → Hotkeys**.

### Example: a wikilink-expanded request

Imagine `Project Brief.md` exists in your vault. In a different note, type and select:

```
Summarise [[Project Brief]] in three bullets.
```

When you run the command:

1. `[[Project Brief]]` is replaced with the full content of `Project Brief.md`.
2. The expanded text is sent to your provider.
3. The summary is inserted under `## AI Result` (or your configured heading).

### Picker mode

In picker mode, the modal shows every `.md` file in your prompts folder plus a "None" option. Pick a file to use it as the system prompt for *this* invocation only — no settings are mutated.

## Providers in detail

| Provider | Endpoint | Wire format | Auth |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Copilot** | `<baseUrl>/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| **Claude** | `<baseUrl>/v1/messages` | Anthropic Messages | `x-api-key: <key>` |
| **Claude (proxy)** | `<baseUrl>/v1/chat/completions` | OpenAI Chat Completions | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` |
| **Gemini** | `<baseUrl>/v1beta/models/<model>:generateContent` | Gemini `generateContent` | API key in query string |
| **Local CLI** | subprocess | `systemPrompt + "\n\n" + userContent` piped to stdin | — |

For the local CLI provider, the plugin spawns the configured command with `shell: false`. Args are split on whitespace; complex quoting requires a wrapper script.

---

## Privacy and security

- Network requests are made **only** to the provider you configure, only when you invoke the command.
- Nothing is uploaded automatically. Vault content is sent to the provider only when it is part of the input you select (or when wikilink expansion pulls in a referenced note, or when "vault note names context" is on).
- API keys are stored locally via Obsidian's plugin data store (`<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ai-assistant/data.json`).
- No telemetry, no analytics, no remote auto-update.

## Development

```bash
npm install
npm run dev    # esbuild watch — rebuilds main.js on every change
npm run build  # tsc --noEmit + esbuild production build
npm test       # vitest run
npm run lint   # eslint
```

To test inside a vault, symlink the repo into `<Vault>/.obsidian/plugins/ai-assistant/`, run `npm run dev`, and reload Obsidian (`Ctrl/Cmd+R`) after changes.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for the full project conventions.
